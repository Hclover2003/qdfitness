The purpose of this app is to provide a very simple, hassle free overview to keep track of what I was eating and how much I was exercising on a regular basis.

Bibigo Mini Wontons' for a simple automated stat for 'wonton'. The pros and cons of this decision are evident, trading in detail and accuracy for time and ease of use. In short, this is a very simplified calorie tracker that should be used as an estimate only. While not completely accurate, it shouldnâ€™t deviate enormously between foods and is meant as a fun little supplement to your everyday food/exercise tracking routine. There are many existing apps out there for calorie tracking in greater depth and detail, that you can use instead (or in complement) with this app if that is what you are looking for."),
